I've been recording the books that I've read in a csv since 2017 and decided to switch over to using the Goodreads website in 2019. While I don't find Goodreads particularly great at recommmending books, I do like the idea of using the data available to better understand reading habits. Before I would painstakingly add genre information and fill out information about the author and book for each entry, but goodreads provides a simple way to [export your data](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-import-or-export-my-books-1553870934590).  

In addition, Paul Klinger made a nice [python script](https://github.com/PaulKlinger/Enhance-GoodReads-Export) to scrap genre information from the website.

If you're interested in questions like, how does my ratings differ than the average or how many pages did I read last year, then try importing your csv into [Paul Klinger's website](https://almoturg.com/bookstats/).
