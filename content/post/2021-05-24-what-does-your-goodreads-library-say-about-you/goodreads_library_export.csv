I enjoy his ability to decipher social interactions with deadpan clarity like realizing that asking his sister to clean her apartment is asking her to be an entirely different person. But at the same time, his internal dialogue can be so out of touch that what happens next, while being pretty average, can seem unexpectedly clever. <br/><br/>I think his ability to explain his apparent selfish behavior in such a way that converts you to advocate for his position is a real talent. I get the feeling all his conversations are either about stories or fuel for a new one. At the same time, it must be frustrating having a family member who can decide how everyone will remember you when you're dead but at the same time loves making you look bad. <br/><br/>His stories do have great comedic timing though. I found myself chuckling quite a bit with the unexpected turns. His writing puts such interesting images in your head like, ""how do palm readers respond to rubber hands?""<br/><br/>I think if there is anything I'd like to take away from his writing it is his ability to guide his reader through uncomfortable situations that always has a satisfying cathartic release.

Apparently not. One thing I hope I remember is that the mathematician approach of solving a simpler problem is often more useful than trying to initially grapple with the complexity of the harder problem. <br/><br/>After reading this book, I think all progress is really just incremental. We like to pretend that using metaphors and moving away from the engineering approach is fresh and exciting. The metaphor that I hear is that ""Henry Ford didn't try to make a faster horse."" But his increased efficiency was trying to make a better car production line. And maybe cars are just more efficient wheelbarrows?<br/><br/>My main gripe with this genre is that the distilled platitudes are so ethereal. It makes sense that they need examples to ground the thoughts but the stories seem like such post hoc simplifications. Something like: I interviewed these billionaires and they all poop on toilets! So I started pooping on toilets and soon I'll cash in!<br/><br/>While these stories are a nice way to paint the world and motivate the platitudes, I don't think my day to day actions will be greatly influenced by this book.

Here are the key takeaways I got stripped of their context:<br/>- If you want to make something new seem familiar then sandwich it between familiar things. This was useful in making Outkast Hey ya a big hit.<br/>- With new habits, a cue to remind you that you did it is important. Think biofilm on teeth.<br/>- When confronting a negative habit, look for things that occur before the undesirable habit and try to engineer those from happening.<br/>- Put yourself on the self-exemption list for casinos in your state.

I think it appeals to so many readers because it takes relatable themes like generational gaps, dysfunctional families, the distortion of our own memories, and dials them up to 11. I was drawn to the experience of pursuing higher education in a family that doesn't. I think this book has gotten a lot of attention because it is an academic rag to riches story. But what really was the point of going to Cambridge for a PhD? What is the value of an education if it isn't to train you to do a job? I think Educated expressed a lot of my discomfort with these topics. How many explanations does it take before someone understands or give up trying to understand?<br/><br/>I get the tired trope that a liberal arts education allows you to evaluate your beliefs and decide for yourself. The alternative being a walking zombie. Playing the roles others have decided for us. However, I don't think Tara is a ""better"" person than her brother Luke because she chose to pursue an education instead of being a farmhand. We all believe unexamined lies and act irrationally. It's easier to scoff at how Tara was raised to not wash hands or avoid hospitals because these lies are more socially repulsive than our own. Education is worshipped as some kind of super power but in the end Tara became estranged from her family. In her case, education was an escape. For others that might find themselves in Tara's situation, education can be a powerful option for a different life but it's not the only way out. All the same, we wouldn't have this great book to talk about if she stayed at home. Should you read it?

I listened to an audible audiobook and there were some obvious limitations with teaching bushcraft through audio. It's useful to have general idea of what's contained in the field of bushcraft but it fails when it comes to explaining the complexities of shelter, and fire starting. A diagram would just be easier to follow. Same with the rapid fire descriptions of edible plants and water reservoirs. However, the description of declination with compasses and triangulating landmarks was pretty awesome and I've never thought about it before.

They unearth mountains of evidence and listen carefully only to deploy counterarguments. I have never seen someone change their mind in such a public setting, even though changing your mind with new evidence is an admirable trait. If you’re anything like me, the thinking that shapes your beliefs is secret. <br/><br/>Huckleberry Finn is Mark Twain’s trojan horse. He even starts by saying ""Person's attempting to find a moral will be banished"". Imagine finding a book on your public library shelves promising adventures. You’ll nuzzle up closely with it in the private nook where your big decisions are made and Mark Twain will do the impossible. He will change your mind. Huck Finn is a relatable character even if you’re not from the countryside. The episodic nature of events on the river seems like such a good example of excellent storytelling. I’m not sure how much writers from tv shows I enjoy take direct inspiration from this book or if it’s just what good writers do. By and by, if you give the book the time it deserves it will change your mind. That could be how you treat dehumanized people in your life. Maybe that means to stop discounting others because their packaging is a bit “too hick”. <br/><br/>I also think the contrivance at the end wasn’t completely out of context for the book. I think Tom Sawyer is Mark Twain pointing fun at the little things we want in a satisfying climax and ending. Even though the happily ever after was provided in the end, the way we got there subverted expectations. Maybe you’ll see how your heart strings are being pulled when you see these cliches in action next time and realize how silly it is and how we are just like Tom Sawyer for wanting it to be that way.<br/>",,,2,,,0,,,,,,",2020-01-01","Classics|22543;Fiction|9848;Historical,Historical Fiction|2020;Literature|1684;Young Adult|1668;Adventure|1565;Academic,School|1462;Novels|800;Academic,Read For School|720;Literature,American|687"

I think the scars from the civil war are there if you look for them, but Sierra Leone is so much more than the tragedies that have affected the people who live there. The people who live there are some of the friendliest, optimistic people I have ever met. I've learned that the bare ingredients needed to live a fulfilling and happy life is so much simpler than you would expect. I would highly recommend this book because there are horrors and redemptions that are grander than any fiction I have read. However, please see that there is so much more to Sierra Leone than this.

If you enjoy seeing master craftsmen doing what they do best then you might find some enjoyment from Ulysses. <br/><br/>Honestly, each chapter is written so differently that they feel like different books. Some are incredibly dense and some are chuckle worthy fart jokes. I think the characters are impossible to completely hate or love and their transient nature just feels like everyday encounters. It is clearly paying homage to Ireland and with that comes a lot of specific references that can be scavenged up and some that feel like they are lost forever.

Some notable examples are the ""Save More Tomorrow"" program or the credit card that's limited by budgeting. It's odd how these ideas that would clearly solve issues aren't easy to implement on the customer side. <br/><br/>Another key takeaway for me was the discrepancy of market value and social norms. For example, a lawyer may volunteer time but refuse to do work for a discounted price. Developing social norms in a workplace also appears to motivate hard work better than market value in the first place. This is why places like startups or big companies like Google can justify spending money on their employees so that they'll feel socially invested in the outcomes.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,"2019-05-15,2019-05-17","Psychology|2930;Nonfiction|2851;Economics|1094;Business|980;Science|647;Self Help|334;Sociology|182;Self Help,Personal Development|154;Audiobook|129;Social Science|125"
