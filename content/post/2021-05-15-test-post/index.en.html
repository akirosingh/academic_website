<p>I’ve been using Everedoo (<a href="https://www.eurugo.com/" class="uri">https://www.eurugo.com/</a>) to ask me two daily questions each day since September 1, 2018. “How was your day?” and “How much sleep did you get?”</p>
<p>Initially I wanted to understand how my satisfaction with the day has fluctuated throughout the month. Since I was recording time spent sleeping, I expected them both to correlate but the correlation is kind of weak.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, I think the fluctuation can be explained by the day before. I think the measure of satisfaction is always going to be relative because there isn’t really a way to normalize. For example: if I spent a week with a series of bad days, the next okay day would seem really great in comparison. I don’t know if there is a way to make these measurements more comparable over time. But that’s something to look into.</p>

<p>Next, I’d like to look at the days where I enter the satisfaction after the days to see if there is a positive bias. I think I like to romanticise the past and it would be cool to see if that’s really what I do.</p>

<p>Actually it looks like my average answers 7-8 come out later in the day.</p>
