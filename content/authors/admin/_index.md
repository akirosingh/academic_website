Adam Kirosingh (CURE:Oh:Sing) is currently a PhD candidate in Prasanna Jagannathan's lab working to uncover the immune mechanisms behind maternal immunity to malaria through successive pregnancies. By generating large datasets from patient samples I hope to drive hypothesis driven experiments to inform vaccination efforts to protect pregnant mothers and their children.

What you won't find out on his {{< staticref "media/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}} is that Adam enjoys [rock climbing](https://instagram.com/memoradam), [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51047534-adam-kirosingh), and [being outdoors](https://www.strava.com/athletes/15203384).
